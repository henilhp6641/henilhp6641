# Hello World!

👋 I'm Henilkumar, a Master's graduate from Concordia University, and a passionate computer engineer with a keen interest in full-stack development. My journey has been enriched by experiences ranging from leading a team at Transcendence Infotech to honing my skills as a Software Developer Intern at GAOTek Inc.

I believe in turning "404 Not Found" into "200 OK" one line of code at a time. Join me in my quest to build the digital world, one emoji 🧱 at a time! Let's break the internet together! 🌐💥
